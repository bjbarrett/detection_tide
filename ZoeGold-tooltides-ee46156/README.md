This repository contains the R script ("tooltides.R") and session info from R ("SessionInfo_R.txt") required to run the main analyses reported in the manuscript, and our dataset ("tooltides.csv"), consisting of cleaned annotations of camera trap data, which have been aggregated to the sequence-level. Two additional scripts, one R script ("dist2coast.R") and one Google Earth Engine script ("distcoast_ee.txt") show how we calculated the distance to the coastal vegetation line for each camera trap.
